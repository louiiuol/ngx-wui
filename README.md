Web UI (`ngx-wui`) offers simple yet effective components to build applications. Just like any other framework, it contains
components made with SCSS and, if necessary, uses TypeScript functions to create UX needed.

> More information on the library [here](./projects/ngx-wui/README.md)

## Development server 💻

First, you must build the library with the following command `npm run build`.

Then, you can run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see demonstration page of the library.
